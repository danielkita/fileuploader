# Simple File Uploader

This is a simple file uploader application that allows you to upload files via an API. Once a file is uploaded, it will return a unique URL where the file can be downloaded. The file will be automatically deleted after 5 seconds from the first download attempt.

## Running the Application

Make sure you are in the root directory of the project on your terminal.

This application uses [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun) as the runtime. If you don't have Bun installed on your machine, you'll have to install it first.

After installing Bun, you can run the application using the following command:

```shell
‚ùØ bun run index.ts
```

This command triggers Bun to execute the `index.ts` script, which is the main entry point to our application.

Once you've initiated the command, the application should start. Monitor the console logs for any potential errors or a confirmation that the server has started successfully.

## API Method

There is one main API method:

### `POST /`

This method is used to upload a file to the application. 

Upon successful upload, the API will return a response in the following JSON format:

```json
{
    "url": "http://localhost:3456/upload/<file-uuid>"
}
```

This URL can be used to download the uploaded file. Please note that the file will only be available for 5 seconds after it has been downloaded for the first time.


## Usage

To upload a file, make a POST request to the `/` endpoint. Note that the request must be of `multipart/form-data` type and the file should be included in the `file` field. 

The server will respond with a JSON containing the unique URL of the uploaded file. Use this URL to download the file. If the file is not downloaded within 5 seconds, the file will be automatically deleted.
